          The song starts with an ominous voice chanting the differences between
          a couple who wanted separate things. The guy was in for the long haul
          and wanted a wife. The girl had other priorities in life. She left her
          hometown to pursue a dream, not to be tied down as a wife. He was a
          star, too. But he was set in his own ways. She was becoming a star and
          was changing like a piece of paper in the wind. Throughout the song,
          Taylor Swift seemingly tries to justify why she did not want to be
          someone’s wife. For this specific person, this could be a letter of
          apology–or a letter of explanation. It all begins in her small
          hometown where nothing ever happened. West Reading, Pennsylvania, had
          a population of 4,400 in 2010–1/10th of the crowds Taylor Swift
          performs to in one night now. That town was way too small for the
          caliber of Taylor Swift. So, she had to leave. When she did this
          change, life turned upside down. In the blink of an eye, Taylor was a
          global superstar. Everything she had once dreamed of, she is living
          now. There was a lot to learn, adapt to, and change.
